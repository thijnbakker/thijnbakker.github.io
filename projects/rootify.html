                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    Rootify represents the evolution of our initial proof-of-concept into a production-ready cloud-based ML application for automated plant root analysis. This project was developed for NPEC researchers to perform advanced organ segmentation, landmark detection, and robotic inoculation workflows. The system bridges the gap between experimental AI and usable tools for real-world plant science research.

            <div class="project-section">
                <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                <p>
                    NPEC researchers needed a scalable, reliable solution to analyze plant root systems at scale. The existing proof-of-concept worked in Jupyter notebooks but wasn't suitable for production use. The challenge was to transform scattered notebooks and experimental code into a robust, cloud-based system that could handle:
                </p>
                <p>
                    ‚Ä¢ High-throughput image processing with varying image qualities<br>
                    ‚Ä¢ Complex root segmentation and landmark detection<br>
                    ‚Ä¢ Integration with robotic inoculation systems<br>
                    ‚Ä¢ Multi-user access with reliable performance<br>
                    ‚Ä¢ Reproducible results across different environments
                </p>
            </div>

                <p>
                    I approached this project with a strong focus on MLOps best practices and production-ready architecture. My strategy involved:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>1. Code Refactoring:</strong> Transformed Jupyter notebooks into a modular Python package with clear separation of concerns<br>
