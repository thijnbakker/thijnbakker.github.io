                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    Developed a comprehensive data-driven scouting system for NAC Breda professional football club, combining advanced machine learning analytics with a robust ethical framework for responsible data usage. This project established both predictive models for player performance analysis and GDPR-compliant data handling procedures, demonstrating how sports analytics can be both powerful and ethically responsible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The project addressed the fundamental question: "What ethical standards should NAC adhere to in order to be considered as an ethically responsible user of the dashboard?" while building machine learning models to predict player performance based on goal-scoring patterns and preferred foot usage.
