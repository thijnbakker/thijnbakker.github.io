# Thijn Bakker - AI & Data Science Portfolio

## About Me

Third-year Data Science & AI student at Breda University of Applied Sciences with a passion for transforming complex problems into elegant solutions. Over the past two years, I've worked with diverse clients including NPEC, NAC Breda, ANWB, and the Content Intelligence Agency, delivering everything from computer vision systems and NLP pipelines to production-ready MLOps deployments.

My journey spans from analyzing climate change impacts on food security to building robotic control systems for plant research, always with a focus on ethical AI and real business value. I thrive at the intersection of technical innovation and practical application.

**Languages:** Dutch (Native), English (Full Professional Proficiency), German (Limited Working Proficiency)
